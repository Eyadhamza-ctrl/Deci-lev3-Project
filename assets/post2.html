            <h1>The Great Pyramid of Giza</h1>
        <p>Rising gloriously on the Giza Plateau, the magnificent achievement of ancient engineering known as the <span class="highlight">Great Pyramid of Giza</span> stands as an icon of Egypt’s rich history. Built over 4,500 years ago, this architectural marvel has fascinated travelers, archaeologists, and historians alike. Beyond its grandeur, the Great Pyramid holds secrets and mysteries that continue to astonish and intrigue.</p>
        
        <h2>A Masterpiece of Precision</h2>
        <p>The Great Pyramid’s precision is one of its most astonishing aspects. Constructed with more than 2.3 million stone blocks, some weighing up to 15 tons, its foundation is remarkably level. Additionally, its near-perfect alignment with the cardinal points demonstrates the ancient Egyptians’ advanced understanding of mathematics and astronomy.</p>
        
        <h2>The Original Appearance</h2>
        <p>Today, the Great Pyramid appears as a rough limestone structure, but originally, it was covered in polished white Tura limestone casing stones. These stones reflected sunlight, earning it the name <span class="highlight">“Ikhet”</span> or “Glorious Light.” This dazzling exterior would have made the pyramid visible from miles away, enhancing its majesty and mystique.</p>
        
        <h2>A Mausoleum Fit for Royalty</h2>
        <p>Built for Pharaoh Khufu (also known as Cheops), the Great Pyramid served as a grand mausoleum. It contains three main chambers: the King’s Chamber, the Queen’s Chamber, and an unfinished subterranean chamber. The King’s Chamber houses a red granite sarcophagus believed to have held Khufu’s remains. The Grand Gallery and air shafts within the structure showcase the Egyptians' architectural brilliance and spiritual beliefs regarding the afterlife.</p>
        
        <h2>The Workforce Behind the Wonder</h2>
        <p>Contrary to popular belief, the Great Pyramid was not built by slaves but by a skilled workforce. Archaeological evidence suggests these workers lived in nearby settlements and were well-fed. The construction process, which took approximately 20 years, required immense labor, organization, and engineering expertise. Each stone in this timeless monument reflects the craftsmanship and dedication of these ancient builders.</p>
        
        <h2>Theories and Mysteries</h2>
        <p>The Great Pyramid has inspired numerous theories regarding its construction and purpose. Some speculate about extraterrestrial involvement, while others believe it served as an astronomical observatory. Despite these speculations, the true marvel lies in the ingenuity of the ancient Egyptians. Although extensive research has been conducted, certain aspects, such as the precise methods used to transport and place the massive stones, remain unresolved mysteries.</p>
        
        <h2>Exploring the Pyramid Today</h2>
        <p>Visitors to the Great Pyramid can experience its grandeur firsthand. While climbing to the top is now prohibited, exploring its interior offers a glimpse into its sophisticated design. Walking through its narrow passageways and standing inside its chambers provides a deep connection to the past. Additionally, the surrounding <span class="highlight">Giza Plateau</span> is home to other remarkable landmarks, including the Sphinx and the pyramids of Khafre and Menkaure.</p>
